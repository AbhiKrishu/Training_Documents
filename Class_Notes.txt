	Pre-requisities :::
	
		Lab :::
		
			AWS Cloud Platform :
			
				Create a AWS free tier Account. 12 months 
					Active Mobile Number
					Active Email ID 
					Active Credit/Debit Card - International Transaction enabled.
					
					https://aws.amazon.com/console/
				
				
		
		Class Notes & Documents :		
					github - Repository 
					
					Create github account.					
					https://github.com/
					
					
		DockerHub :::
					Container Registry
					https://hub.docker.com/
					
					
		
		Introduction to Kubernetes :::
		
			Application Builds and Deployments :::
			
			Application ???
			
				Kubernetes is Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool :
				It is used to Deploy the Micro-Service Based Applications and Services 
				Used to Achive Continous Deployment without Downtime
				
			Deployment ???
			
				What is Application Deployment ???
				
					Artifacts ???  --> 
					
				Life Cycle of Application :::
					
					Developed 		--> 	Java Web Application - *.java (High Level Language)
					
					Build 			--> 	Compile the source Code 
					
					Create Artifacts -->  	Binaries (Executable code) *.exec/*.war/*.jar/*.dll/
					
					Artifacts are Deployed to Target Environments (QA/UAT/PROD)
					
				Environments ::
				
				Non-PROD Environment															Production Environment
					
				Dev Environment
				Build Environment		Unit Testing 
				Testing
					QA - Quality Assurance Testing 
						
					UAT - User Acceptance Testing						=====>						Prod Environment
					
			
			
			Scenario 1 ::
			
			
				Developer :: Create Java Program  *.java  IDE   +20 Lines 
			
				build 			- Compile & Create Artifacts	mywebwebapp.war
				
				Unit Testing 	-	Run the Application --
									Web Application Server  - Tomcat / Nginx
									
									openjdk11,Tomcat8.0 --> Tested the Application, and completed Unit Testing   mywebwebapp_Img1
									
									Docker --> Build an appln Image - mywebwebapp_Img1(mywebwebapp.war,openjdk11,Tomcat8.0)
									
				Containerization ::
				
						It is a process of packaging the Application along with the dependencies. 
									
				Promote the Appln. 
				
				QA	Environment		-	mywebwebapp_Img1	& run the application using containers.
				
				UAT Environment		- 	mywebwebapp_Img1	& run the application using containers.
				
				PROD Environment	- 	mywebwebapp_Img1	& run the application using containers.
				
				Docker Engine :::
	
					Create Application image 
					Create Containers 
					Docker Compose 	-- Run Multiple Containers as a single Service.
					
							Application Service -- created using 3-tier Application Architecture ::
							
								Front_End Layer				C1
								Application Layer			C2 
								Back_End Database Layer 	C3
				
					Container Orchestration Tool :::
						
						Docker Swarm 	-- Orchestrate the Containers 	- only for Docker Container
								It is used to combine, and ensure High Availability of Containers
								Create Replicas of Containers.
								
								Auto-Scaling 
								Load Balancing
					
					
				Kubernetes 				-- Orchestrate the Containers
			
				Kubernetes is Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool
				It is used to Deploy the Micro-Service Based Applications and Services 
				Used to Achive Continous Deployment without any Downtime
					Supports Relicas, Auto-Scaling, Load-Balancing
					
						10000 Users		50 Replicas of Containers 

						50000 Users More Traffic 
			
				Managed Services :::		
				
					AWS - EKS 
					Azure - AKS
					GCP - GKS
					
				
				Monolith Application Architecture :::
							Tightly Coupled Application :::
							
					Billing System :: Destop Application 

						Functions ::
							UI
							Billing Process 	--> fix the issue 
							Stock Maintainence 
							Data Log 
							Customers Database Mgmt
				
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
							Loosely Coupled Application :::
				
					Web Application :::
					Mobile Apps :::::
					
					Netflix / amazon.com ==> web appln
					
					www.amazon.com 
					
					user_registration 	- Service1 - developer1 -  independently developed - tested, deployed to QA/UAT , Released to Prod
					Sign_In 			- Service2 - developer2 -  independently developed - tested, deployed to QA/UAT , Released to Prod
					Search 
					Add to Cart 
					Place the order 
					payment 
					confirm the order 
					track the order

				What is DevOps ???
				
					DevOps is software Development Strategy to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and the Operation Team to achive Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery / Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
				
				
				
				DevOps Stage ::

					Continous Development 
							- it is a capability of Development team to do continuous Coding *.java 
							
						Use IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, pycharm - can be easily integrated with GIT, Jenkins
					
					Continous Integration 
							Integrated the changes (Artifacts / Images) 
							
						Tools ::: jenkins, docker, kubernetes 
					
					Continous Testing 
						Tools : jenkins, selenium 
					
					Continous Delivery / Deployment
						Both are meant for Production Release . 
					
						Continous Delivery 		==> Expect Manual Approval for Production Release 
						
						Continous Deployment	==> It is completely Automated. Doesnt required any Manual approvals
						
						Without any Downtime ! 
						
						Kubernetes !
					
					Continous Monitoring
